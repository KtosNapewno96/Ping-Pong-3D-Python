⚡ **A realistic 3D ping-pong simulation in Python using Ursina and NumPy**

PingPong3DRealistic is a 3D table tennis simulation focusing on **realistic ball physics**, spin, and AI behavior.  

> **Warning:** The game is quite challenging! 😅  
> The difficulty comes from realistic ball physics, spin (topspin/backspin/sidespin), air drag, and AI behavior.  
> The AI is not perfect but requires reflexes and prediction to beat.

## 🎮 Controls

- Move your paddle with the **mouse**: X axis = left/right, Y axis = up/down
